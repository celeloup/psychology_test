## What is it ?

A personnal project for the end of study memoire of a friend studying psychology. The app is a simple questionnaire to collect data for a **_psychology study_**, with the possibility for the user to retrieve its results or continue where they left off easily by referencing their email. It also features an *admin view*, displaying all the answers, some basic statistics and the possibility to download the data in `.xlxs` format for future processing. The questionnaire is actually 4 different questionnaires with slightly different questions, given to the user based on its ID. Each questionnaire also features a MBTI test.

## Stack & Architecture

This app was built using a **MERN** (MongoDB, Express, React.js, Node.js) stack and a **MVC** (Model View Controler) architecture.

- React JS 17
- Node 16
- Express 4
- Mongoose 5
- Dotenv 8
- Axios
- ‚Ä¶

The data is hosted on [MongoDB Cloud Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/lp/try4) and the app was hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). As of today, since the study was closed years ago, the app is no longer available online.

## Launch

‚ö†Ô∏è The app requires some environnement variables (the database credentials for example). ‚ö†Ô∏è

```bash
# in /.env
MONGODB_URI=YOUR_URL_HERE

# And in /client/.env
REACT_APP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password
REACT_APP_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
```

Start by installing all the dependencies.

```bash
npm install ; cd client ; npm install ; cd ..
```

Launch the back server.

```bash
npm start
```

Once it runs with no errors, you can start the client.

```bash
cd client ; npm start
```
